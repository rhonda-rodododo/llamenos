# Completed Backlog

## 2026-02-11: Epic 32 — Multi-Provider Telephony Configuration

- [x] Shared types: `TelephonyProviderConfig`, `TelephonyProviderType`, `PROVIDER_REQUIRED_FIELDS`, `TELEPHONY_PROVIDER_LABELS`
- [x] Refactored `getTelephony()` from sync to async — reads provider config from SessionManagerDO, falls back to Twilio env vars

- [x] Caller phone numbers redacted in all WebSocket broadcasts
- [x] Browser notifications use generic text (no caller info on lock screens)

- [x] Audit logs include IP/country/UA metadata
- [x] Console.logs removed from production paths
- [x] Deployment URL removed from all documentation

### Epic 28: Voicemail Fallback

- [x] Voicemail voice prompts in all 13 languages
- [x] Queue timeout: `<Leave/>` after 90 seconds via QueueTime check in wait music
- [x] `<Enqueue action=...>` routes to voicemail on queue exit (leave/queue-full/error)
- [x] CallRecord type expanded: `'unanswered'` status + `hasVoicemail` field
- [x] CallRouter DO: `handleVoicemailLeft()` — moves call to history, broadcasts `voicemail:new`
- [x] Voicemail transcription via Workers AI Whisper, encrypted for admin (ECIES)
- [x] Voicemail thank-you message in 13 languages after recording
- [x] Frontend: unanswered badge + voicemail indicator in call history
- [x] `voicemailReceived` audit event
- [x] i18n: `unanswered`, `hasVoicemail`, `voicemailReceived`, `voicemailPrompt` keys in all 13 locales

### Security Hardening (from deep audit — round 2)
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Auth tokens replaced with BIP-340 Schnorr signatures (was SHA-256 hash — auth bypass)
- [x] WebSocket subprotocol encoding fixed to base64url (no `=` / `/` chars that crash WS handshake)
- [x] WebSocket server echoes `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: llamenos-auth` header (WS spec compliance)
- [x] Caller PII removed from notification function signature (defense in depth)
- [x] Encrypted draft notes cleaned from localStorage on logout
- [x] Profile settings backend accepts name + phone updates (admin can set phone to receive calls)

## 2026-02-09: Epic 29 — Configurable Settings, WebAuthn & Backlog Completion

### Feature 1: Configurable Call Settings
- [x] Queue timeout configurable (30-300s, default 90s) — admin settings UI + backend

- [x] Server-side WebAuthn lib (registration + authentication flows)
- [x] Dual auth: `Authorization: Bearer {schnorr}` and `Authorization: Session {token}`
- [x] WebAuthn credential CRUD in SessionManager DO

- [x] i18n: `phone.*` keys in all 13 locales

### Feature 5: E2E Test Isolation

- [x] `test.beforeEach` reset in all mutating test files
- [x] `workers: 1` in playwright.config.ts for serial execution
- [x] Test reset endpoints in all 3 DOs (Session, Shift, CallRouter)

### Security Hardening (Audit Round 3)
- [x] Hash caller phone numbers before DO storage (SHA-256 with domain separator)
- [x] ~~Hash phone numbers in ban list~~ (reverted — admin needs original numbers for ban management)
- [x] Move rate limiting from in-memory Map to DO storage (persists across Worker restarts)
- [x] Guard Twilio webhook validation — only skip when BOTH dev mode AND localhost
- [x] Rate-limit invite validation endpoint (10 req/min per IP)
- [x] Hash IP addresses in audit log entries (truncated SHA-256)
- [x] Stop broadcasting volunteer pubkeys in presence updates (anonymous counts only)
