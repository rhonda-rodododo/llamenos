# Next Backlog

## High Priority (Pre-Launch)
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Tunnel for local dev with telephony webhooks
- [x] Configure production wrangler secrets (TWILIO_*, ADMIN_PUBKEY) — deployed and running
- [ ] Test full call flow end-to-end: incoming call -> CAPTCHA -> parallel ring -> answer -> notes -> hang up *(requires real phone + telephony account)*

## Security Audit Findings (2026-02-12)

### Fixed (committed ddc95ec)
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Vonage webhook validation was `return true` — now HMAC-SHA256
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Caller phone hash leaked in spam report WS response
- [x] **HIGH**: Mass assignment — volunteer self-update now restricted to safe fields allowlist
- [x] **HIGH**: SSRF in provider test — ARI URL validation, internal IP blocking, fetch timeout
- [x] **HIGH**: WebSocket flooding — rate limit 30 msgs/10s with auto-disconnect
- [x] **HIGH**: WebSocket prototype pollution — reject `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype`
- [x] **HIGH**: Weak KDF — upgraded SHA-256 concat to HKDF-SHA256 for note encryption
- [x] **HIGH**: Security headers — COOP, no-referrer, expanded CSP and Permissions-Policy

### Medium (fixed in 6d3deac)
- [x] Session token revocation: logout API + server-side session delete
- [x] WebSocket call authorization: verify call state + volunteer ownership for answer/hangup/spam
- [x] Invite code rate limit: reduced from 10 to 5 per minute
- [x] Custom field label/option length validation: 200 char max
- [x] Presence broadcast: volunteers get `{ hasAvailable }` only, admins get full counts
- [ ] Encrypt/hash note metadata (callId, authorPubkey) to prevent correlation analysis — *trade-off: breaks server-side filtering/grouping; notes content is already E2EE*

### Low / Future
- [ ] Add auto-lock/panic-wipe mechanism for device seizure scenarios
- [ ] SRI hashes for PWA service worker cached assets
- [ ] Consider re-auth step-up for sensitive actions (e.g., unmasking volunteer phone numbers)
- [ ] Auth token nonce-based replay protection (currently mitigated by HTTPS + Schnorr signatures + 5min window)

## Multi-Provider Telephony (Epics 32–36) — COMPLETE
- [x] Epic 32: Provider Configuration System (admin UI, API, DO storage, connection test)
- [x] Epic 33: Cloud Provider Adapters (SignalWire extends TwilioAdapter, Vonage, Plivo)
- [x] Epic 34: WebRTC Volunteer Calling (in-browser call answer, provider-specific SDKs)
- [x] Epic 35: Asterisk ARI Adapter (self-hosted SIP, ARI bridge service)
- [x] Epic 36: Telephony Documentation (provider comparison, setup guides, in-app help)

## Low Priority (Post-Launch)
- [ ] Add call recording playback in notes view
- [x] Marketing site + docs at llamenos-hotline.com (Astro + Cloudflare Pages)
